## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Docker Desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (included with Docker Desktop)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-aggregator-api.git
   cd news-aggregator-api
   ```

2. **Install Laravel dependencies**: Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Create the .env file**: Copy the .env.example file to create a new .env file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Generate an application key**: This key is required by Laravel to secure your application.
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5. **Set up database credentials in .env**: Make sure the .env file is updated to connect to the MySQL container:
    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=mysql
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=laravel
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=root
    ```

6. **Run database migrations**: Run the following Artisan command to set up the database structure:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

## Running the Docker Environment

The application uses Docker to provide a consistent development environment. The Docker setup includes services for Laravel (PHP-FPM), MySQL, and Nginx.

> **Note:** I'm not sure the Docker setup will work perfectly for everyone. If you encounter issues with Docker, you can start the application using the Laravel built-in server with the following command:
> ```bash
> php artisan serve
> ```

### How to Run the Docker Environment

1. **Build and start the Docker containers**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start the containers. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Run Laravel commands inside the Docker container**: To run Artisan commands or Composer commands, enter the app container using:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app bash
    ```
    Then, inside the container, you can run commands like:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

3. **Stop the Docker environment**: To stop the containers, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

4. **Run Docker in detached mode**: To run the Docker containers in the background:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available via Swagger. You can view the documentation by visiting the following URL:

- [API Documentation](http://localhost:8000/api/documentation) (local environment)

The Swagger configuration file is included in the repository. You can find it in the `storage/api-docs/api-docs.json` file.

The documentation includes details about the available API endpoints for authentication, articles, user preferences, and password reset.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, log in, and log out users via API endpoints.
- **Password Reset**: Users can request password reset links and reset passwords using tokens.
- **Article Management**: Fetch articles from multiple sources (like The Guardian and The New York Times).
- **Personalized News Feed**: Users can set preferences for news sources, categories, and authors to get a personalized feed.
- **Caching**: The API uses caching for frequently requested endpoints to improve performance.
- **Rate Limiting**: Rate limits are applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search articles by keyword, category, source, and date.

## Additional Notes

- **Caching**: The application uses Laravelâ€™s caching system to cache API responses for articles and user feeds. Cache is cleared when new articles are fetched or when user preferences are updated.
  
- **Rate Limiting**: The API is rate-limited to prevent abuse. You can configure the limits in `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php`.

- **Password Reset**: Users can request a password reset link via the `/api/password/email` endpoint and reset their password using the token sent in the email.

- **Swagger Integration**: The API is documented using Swagger, and the documentation can be regenerated using the following command:
    ```bash
    php artisan l5-swagger:generate
    ```
